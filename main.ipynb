    "# Project Summary: Sorting Robot with a Twist\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "Develop an algorithm that enables a robot arm to identify and sort objects (e.g., colored cubes) into designated bins based on their color.\n",
    "## Robot Platform\n",
    "Utilize the Panda robot manipulator, assuming knowledge of the objects colors.\n",
    "## Algorithm Steps\n",
    "For each detected object $i$:\n",
    "- Compute the picking position $p_{pick}$ and the placing position $p_{place}$ based on the object's color.\n",
    "- Use inverse kinematics to obtain the robot configurations $q_{pick}$ and $q_{place}$.\n",
    "## Control Strategies\n",
    "- **Joint-Space Trajectory Interpolation**: Move from pick to place positions using interpolated joint trajectories between $q_{pick}$ and $q_{place}$.\n",
    "- **Resolved-Rate Motion Control**: Use Cartesian velocity control to reach pick and place poses smoothly.\n",
    "## Analysis\n",
    "- Plot and compare trajectories for both strategies (joint and Cartesian space).\n",
    "- Analyze end-effector path smoothness, execution time, and sorting accuracy.\n",
    "## Extra Steps: Camera Integration\n",
    "Simulate a camera to enable the robot to find the location and color of the spheres based on visual input. The sensing can be done in two ways:\n",
    "1. **OpenCV Processing**:\n",
    "   - Use OpenCV to process the camera image.\n",
    "   - Apply HSV color masking to find the pixel coordinates of each berry.\n",
    "2. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**:\n",
    "   - Use a CNN that takes the raw camera image as direct input.\n",
    "   - Train the CNN to learn its own policy for \"seeing\" the berries.  \n"
